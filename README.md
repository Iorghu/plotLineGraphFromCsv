# plotLineGraphFromCsv
Small python project which opens a .csvs file and creates an .html containing the linegraph of the data. Does this an endless loop. Additionally opens a local .html, which reloads the graph every x seconds.

Using some external application (eg. included ExampleLogger) and using  Full-Screen-Mode in the webbrowsers is an easy way to monitor the data of interest in a  semi-live manner.
